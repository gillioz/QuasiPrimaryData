QuasiPrimaryData
================

The Mathematica notebook `QuasiPrimaryData.nb` computes the scaling dimension, spin, and OPE coefficient squared of all quasi-primary operators entering the OPE of two Virasoro primaries.

The data generated in the cases of the Ising model (primaries sigma and epsilon) and of the free scalar field theory (primary TTbar) is listed in the directory `CFTdata`. This goes up to scaling dimension 100, which means for instance more than 2000 quasi-primary operators in the sigma-epsilon OPE.

Part of this data has been used in [arXiv:1912.05550](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.05550).
